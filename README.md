# true-shuffel.com

Landing page for **true-shuffel** — a service that brings *real shuffle* back to music streaming.

Most streaming platforms do not truly randomize playlists. Instead, they repeat patterns or only play a small subset of tracks.  
**true-shuffel fixes this** by playing every song exactly once in a truly random order — just like classic MP3 players.

This repository contains the official dark-mode landing page and beta signup.

## 🧠 How true shuffle works

true-shuffel uses a **non-repeating random permutation** algorithm (e.g. Fisher–Yates shuffle) to ensure:

1. every song appears exactly once  
2. order is truly random  
3. playback state is preserved
